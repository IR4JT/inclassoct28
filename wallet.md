# What it is
My wallet is a green. My brother gave me this four years ago and it still is good.

# Why I won’t leave without it
I cannot leave without it since I use it for everything. For example, I have a course at 6pm and MSU locks the doors to the building so I have to tap my MSU ID on the scanner to open the doors.
