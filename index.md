Below are three things that I won't leave home without.

# Why I won’t leave without keys
I use my keys to enter my apartment as you have to tap a RFID card to unlock the front doors then use it for the elevators. I also need them to unlock my door to my room.

# Why I won’t leave without my phone
I use my phone for music, checking grades and also importantly getting the bus information so I do not have to wait so long for the bus.

# Why I won’t leave without wallet
I cannot leave without it since I use it for everything. For example, I have a course at 6pm and MSU locks the doors to the building so I have to tap my MSU ID on the scanner to open the doors.
